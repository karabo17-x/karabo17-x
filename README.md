## 🔐 My Cybersecurity Path

I'm diving into:

- 🧠 **Networking**: TCP/IP, firewalls, DNS, VPNs — know your packets!
- 🐧 **Linux Mastery**: Bash scripts, cron jobs, system internals
- 🧰 **Pentesting Tools**: Metasploit, Burp Suite, Wireshark, nmap
- 🕵️‍♂️ **Ethical Hacking**: Capture The Flag (CTF) games, bug bounty hunting
- 🔐 **Cryptography**: Learning how data stays secure (or doesn't!)
- 🛡️ **Secure Coding**: Writing code that doesn’t get pwned
